Things I want to know:
1. Realistically, how expensive would this be? Tree-sitter is already parsing the files, would it be that much more expensive to count the number of times a function appears throughout the source code
2. This should only count instances in the source code, not the actual amount of times a function runs during execution. 
3. The purpose of the tier list is to give users an idea of what functions are important when approaching a new code base.
